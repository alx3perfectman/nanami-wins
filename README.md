Welcome to Github, you can follow me if you want.
Hello hello, My skins are inspired by fanarts and some friends, so if you find inspiration in my skins, I ask you to please give me credits... (⁠๑⁠•⁠﹏⁠•⁠) or well, mention me in a social network, is fine

Ehh... Hello ^^" my name is nanami, but you can call me nani if ​​you want. You can come to me whenever you like,It doesn't bother me or even bother me, in fact... I would like to chat with people from time to time!
I'm a little interested in the creators of server safe, they have such nice skins. Sometimes I got inspiration from them! But not all my skins are insp, I have my own style, so I use on my name "insp" or "my style" (⁠>⁠0⁠<⁠；⁠)
